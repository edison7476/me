Everyday, as programmers, we are using math while coding in every project even sometimes we didn’t realize. A very common example would be a array-for-loop, every time when we check if the condition has been meet using ” i < array.length”, the “<“(less than) operation we are applying is just a basic math comparison. In this blog, I will show an example of how to use math in solving a programming problem I have encountered instead of hard-coding approaches, like magic. But notice, using powerful math method to solve certain problem extremely easily come with a feeling of cheating, one important thing to keep in mind is the most valuable take-away is the understanding of the math concept and algorithm behind the scene, and being able to explain the way math works is amazing.

Here is the problem:

Imaging there is 100 rabbits, lined up and waiting for you to play a game with them. Every round, you will walk through the line, each time you move, you will stop at one rabbit and play with the rabbit.

Each time, you either put a hat on the rabbit if it doesn’t have one, or take the hat from the rabbit if it already has one.

You will keep moving until you reach the end of the line, then starts a new round.

Every round, you are only allowed to move certain steps, for example, the first round, you can only move 1 step every time, second round, you can only move 2 steps at a time… the game ends when you finish the 100th(the total number of rabbits) round. Meaning, the first round, you will stop at every rabbit, in the last round (100th), you will only stop at the last rabbit, then the game end.

Write a function that take the total number of rabbit (100 in this case, also meaning you will need to go 100 rounds), and returns a number which is the total number of rabbits that has a hat on after the game ends.

First lets break down the problem. We have 100 rabbits lined up, which looks like an array with length of 100 in the programing world. And each rabbit has one simple status which is: it either has a hat on or not, so the value of each element in the rabbits array can be seen as true or false, or simply a value of 0 or 1. So in the end, we can simply calculate how many 1s we have in the array after the game finished, that’s the number of rabbits with a hat on. Each round, we are going through the whole array with certain steps for each move, and we are doing 100 rounds, so clearly enough, the most straight forward approach to solve the problem would be using a loop within a loop, the outer loop would iterate through each round, and the inner loop will iterate through the rabbits array.

  var rabbitArray = new Array(numberOfRabbits);
            //create new empty array with length of numberOfRabbits
  for (var i = 1; i &lt;= numberOfRabbits; i++){
            // 100 rounds, in each round
    for (var j = i - 1; j &lt; rabbitArray.length; j += i){
            // iterate over rabbits array, and move exactly i steps every time
              // take action, put a hat on the rabbit or take the hat off
      if (rabbitArray[j] === 1){
        rabbitArray[j] = 0;
      } else {
        rabbitArray[j] = 1;
      }
    }
  }
  var counter = 0;
  for (var k = 0; k &lt; rabbitArray.length; k++){
    if (rabbitArray[k] === 1){
      counter++;
    }
  }         // calculate the final result
  return counter;
}
func(100)

This would work, but clearly the time complexity is n-square(O(n^2)) which can be pretty expensive (10,000 computation in this case) when n (the total number of rabbits) gets bigger, so how can we make it better? (There is a lot we can do to optimize the code above, but that’s not our goal) Keep in mind, I’m not going to refactor the code to make it better, instead, I will look deep into the algorithm and try to figure out a better approach.



Now let’s go back and take a look at our rabbits array, think each rabbit is representing a number “p” which is the index of its position in the array from 1~100 (100 rabbits), and use the variable “n” to represent the step we are taking in each round which is also from 1~100. With that being said, let’s think about what relationship between the numbers each rabbit represents and the steps we are taking in each round is needed for us to stopped at a certain rabbits? For example, imagine we are trying to stop at the rabbit representing the number 8 (8th rabbit in array, with index of 7), so k = 8 in this case, so what values of the steps n is needed for us to stop at this 8th rabbit?



The answer is [1, 2, 4, 8], meaning there are 4 possible values for n, also meaning in our game where we have 100 rabbits, we would stopped at the 8th rabbit for 4 times (4 possible n). So sure enough to say, in order for us to stop at a certain rabbit which represents a number “k”, the steps “n” we are taking in a certain round has to be a factor of “k”, meaning “k % n === 0” in the coding world.



If what I just said above does make sense to you, you should be thinking about what’s the next step we are going to take, in fact, we are really close. After knowing the relationship of the rabbit-number and the step-number, the final thing we need to think about is how many times we need to stop at a rabbit in order for it to have a hat on after the game ended. Yes, that’s right, it gets much easier at this point, if the total number of the factors of a certain rabbit-number is odd, the rabbit will have a hat on in the end. For example, the 8th rabbit won’t have a hat after the game end because the factors it has is [1, 2, 4, 8], and the total is 4, which is even.

    //find all the factors and push into the result array
    for (var i = 1; i &lt;= num; i++){

        result.push(i);
      }
    }
    //check if the total number of factors stored in result array is odd, if it is, means this &quot;rabbit&quot; will have a hat on in the end, so we increase the counter by 1.

This approach gives us the exactly same result as the first “naive” pure-coding approach, as you can see, the second one is cleaner and has a better performance in terms of time complexity.


At this point, you should be able to see the benefits from using math method in solving a real coding interview problem. But guess what, this is not the end. We can even make this better, using math, of course. Do you have any idea? Take a look at the code below, it will return us the same result as the previous two approach, but, much better, like magic!

What???

Yes! This is the final approach to solve this problem using math, like magic! Many people might already know what’s going on behind the scene after so much reading at this point. But remember, simply answering this question in this way will not impress anyone and will not get you a job or make you look any smarter, because people would have no idea of what are you talking about, but understand the full logic and be able to explain the whole algorithm to other people might do.

So what just happened? Lets dig into the algorithm again and find out how does this works.



Remember the second approach we took to solve the problem? It looks for the total number of factors of each rabbit-numbers where, and if the total-number-of-factors of a certain rabbit-number is odd, this rabbit will have a hat on after the game ends. The math logic behind our final approach is exactly the same as the second one.

For example, our old friend, the 8th “rabbit”, has 4 factors [1, 2, 4, 8]. The pattern I want to point out here is, for every factor of a number, it have to has a “pair-factor”, no exceptions. In this case, for the 8th “rabbit” which represents the number “8”, the factor “1” has a “pair-factor” of “8”, so the factor and its “pair-factor” could have a product value of “8”, and vice-versa, the factor “8” also has a “pair-factor” which is “1”. It is the same situation for the factor “2” and “4”.

With that being said, many people might already noticed the issue, if every factor has its “pair-factor”, each factor-pair has two number, which is an even number, how can we ended up with a number that has its total-number-of-factors as an odd number? If you think you have the right answer, Yes!, it is the right answer! If the square-root of a number is an integer, the total-number-of-factors of the number is odd, for example, 1, 4, 9, 16… Now the question is why?

Lets take a look at the pair-factors of the number 9, which is [1, 3, 9], it has 3 numbers in total, which is odd. Like we discussed before, each factor has it’s own pair. In this case, the factor 1 has a pair-factor 9 and vice-versa. So what about the factor 3? It actually is the same case. The factor 3 needed a pair-factor as well in order to have the product of the pair to be 9, so its pair-factor is actually also 3, which is itself. Obviously and importantly, 3 is the square-root of 9. Put this in another word, only the number has a pair-factor with two same numbers can have its total-number-of-factors to be odd. Now if you go back and test all three approaches, they all give us the same result, Problem solved!

Isn’t this amazing? By using math, we successfully solved a programing problem in a one-line function! We may not gonna be able to use math in this way for every problem we encountered while programing, but it is worth to keep in mind and it has the potential to improve your code in an amazing way, like Magic!

At last, I want to put out the last question: In our third pure-math solution, how does “Math.floor(Math.sqrt(numberOfRabbits))” gives us the total number of rabbits that has a hat on after the game ends? Now I believe you are able to figure it out.
